### Description
This app was created using React and is a dashboard to represent certain attributes of streaming services to help a user decide which subscription is worth it for them.
The main page displays two graphs that compare universal characteristics (meta data) of the streaming services against one another. The buttons on the top allow you to 
navigate to pages dedicated to displaying information only about that streaming service.

### Usage
The first thing the user will see is the Meta Data page along with the buttons to navigate to the specific pages as shown below.

Clicking on either of the buttons will bring you to a page similar to one of these pages:
